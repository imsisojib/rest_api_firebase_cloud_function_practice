    ***Install Node.js first
    Step-1: Install Firebase tools
        npm install -g firebase-tools npm
    Step-2: firebase login (login to firebase using CLI)
    Step-3: firebase init (choose any option using SPACEBAR)
        for this project I selected Firebase Cloud Functions 
    Step-4: choose language type JavaScript
    Step-4: Allow install dependencies. (it will config the project and download index.js file)
    Step-5: Install Express
        cmd: npm i express
    Step-6: Install cors
        cmd: npm i cors

    ***After creating first Route test the Route
    Step-7: change directory to "functions" folder where index.js is located in project directory.
    Step-8: run local express server by using 
        cmd: npm run serve
    now localhost will be live and output can be get in any browser as well as "Postman" by giving base localhost url. For Example: http://localhost:5001/rest-api-and-cloud-functions/us-central1/app is the base url for this project in my pc.


    ***Deploy Project/Functions
    To deploy Cloud Functions there is need of Billing Account. After setting up billing account simple run 'Firebase Deploy' to deploy functions to the firebase and there we'll get remote base url which can be used for the API. Thanks.


    ***gitignore

    1. ignore specific file from any directory:
    to remove any specific file from any directory just add the file name into gitignore.
    like: permissions_key.json (if only use .json it will ignore all .json extention files.) and again only adding 'permissions_key' won't work.
    2. ignore specific folder
    add like: /Library(Library is folder name)
    again Library may be Library/library. so all L/libray can be ignored.
    add like: /[Ll]ibrary or /[Bb]ooks

    3. ignore folder files into another folder
    add like: /Assests/AssetsTools* //will ignore all files into 'AssetsTools' folder.
